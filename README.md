data-science-exploration
==============================

Repo for exploring and learning ML methodologies and algorithms

Set Up
------------
### Package dependency
I use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage all package versions and dependencies to ensure reproducibility. Then I create [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) by exporting the poetry:
```bash
poetry export --without-hashes --with dev -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt
``` 

For others, you can just use the requirements.txt to recreate the same Python environment. In you terminal:
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mirandawsy/sy-data-science-exploration.git

# go to the project folder
cd sy-data-science-exploration

# create a conda environment
conda create --name ds-explore python==3.9.* -y

# activate the conda env
conda activate ds-explore

# install all dependencies from the requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (optional) install this repo
pip install -e .
```

If you don't have poetry installed, you can check it's [website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for the recommended way to install. I used:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3.9 -
```

After installing the poetry, f you cannot run ```poetry --version```, you can stry adding the Poetry's bin directory in your `PATH` like this 
```bash
export PATH="/Users/YourUserFolder/.local/bin:$PATH"
```
